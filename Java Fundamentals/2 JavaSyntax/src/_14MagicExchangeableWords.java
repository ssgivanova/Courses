//	Write a method that takes as input two strings of equal length, and returns Boolean if they are exchangeable or not.
//	Exchangeable are words where the characters in the first string can be replaced to get the second string. Example:
//	egg and add are exchangeable, but aabbccbb and nnooppzz are not. (First bb corresponds to oo, but second bb
